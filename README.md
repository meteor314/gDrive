# Installations

## Python

[Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## PyDrive

[PyDrive](https://pythonhosted.org/PyDrive/) is a Python library for Google Drive API.

```bash
pip install PyDrive
```

# Configuration

## Google Drive API

Client ID and Client Secret can be obtained from [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).

Download the client configuration file from the Google API Console and save it as **_client_secrets.json_** in your working directory.

Create a file named **_token.json_** in the same directory as your script. This file will store the userâ€™s access and refresh tokens, and is created automatically when the authorization flow completes for the first time.

Here is the structure of my working directory:

```bash
.
|-- README.md
|-- client_secrets.json
|-- main.py
|-- schedule.py
|-- token.json
|-- config.ini
```

In the **_main.py_** file, replace the **_local_folder_path_** and **_drive_folder_id_** with your own values.

### Example of content of config.ini file

```bash
[FOLDER]
LOCAL_FOLDER_PATH  = C:\Users\admin\Desktop\test
DRIVE_FOLDER_ID =0AL9R7YLLZyi_Uk9PVA
IS_SHARE_DRIVE = True
[CONFIG]
DATA_BASE = database.db
[RUN]
IS_RUNNING = 0
[LOG]
LOG_FILE = logs.log
```

# Installation

You need pip to install the required packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# How to run :

To execute the script, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

# How work the database :

By default, **_is uploaded_** is set to _null_ for all files. When the file is uploaded to Google Drive, the **_is_uploaded_** is set to 1.

# How to schedule the script :

## Windows

And to schedule the script, follow the steps below:

- Open the Windows Task Scheduler by searching for "Task Scheduler" in the Start menu.

- Click on "Create Task" in the right-hand pane.

- Give your task a name and a description, and then select the "Triggers" tab.
- Click on "New" to create a new trigger.

- Select "Daily" as the trigger type, and choose the time you want the task to run. In this example, we want it to run every day at 3:00 PM.

- Click on the "Actions" tab and then click on "New".
- Select "Start a program" as the action type.

- In the "Program/script" field, enter the path to your Python executable. This is usually something like "C:\Python39\python.exe" (depending on your Python version and installation directory).

- In the "Add arguments" field, enter the path to your Python script. In this example, it would be "C:\path\to\my_script.py".

- Click on "OK" to save the action, and then click on "OK" again to save the task.

- Now your Python script will run automatically based on the trigger you set.

## Linux

You can create a cron job to run a script every minute, hour, day etc. To create a cron job, open a terminal and type:

```bash
crontab -e
```
